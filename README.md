</h1>

Memory Game is a project made alongside my course in [B7Web](https://b7web.com.br/fullstack/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMI-7eYj5vT-QIVEz6RCh2VfgXQEAAYASAAEgJfifD_BwE&ref=I24108426I) in order to practice React and Typescript, mainly. It is, as the name says, a basic memory game that you have to guess the positions of two equal items among all the others available to click. It has also a timer and a counter of how many moves you needed to finish the game.
